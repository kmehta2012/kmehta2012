# Hi!

I'm skilled at systems-level programming and making Gen-AI based apps.

**C is my favorite programming language.** I've built explicit memory allocators and high-performance HTTP servers from scratch in it.

Experienced in building RAGs and agentic architectures using tools like LangGraph, Smolagents, and Transformers.

Currently trying to get into rigorous Machine Learning, trying to become a god at it, and hopefully be good enough one day to work at the frontier.

I absolutely adore Theoretical CS and Math.

## What I'm Building Right Now
* A top-10 SWE-bench coding agent
* A blog series on making code blazingly fast

## Things I Want to Explore Soon
* **Automated theorem proving** - make one myself for 0th or 1st order logic
* **Training a NN for solving math** - hopefully replicate the recent IMO gold results by several labs
* **RL and "solving" games** - replicating what DeepMind did
* **Video explainer on Group Theory and Rubik's Cubes** - how Kociemba's algorithm uses group theory. Basically make the best explainer on this topic available on the internet
* **Supplement my existing 2×2 cube solver** with different 3×3 solvers - one implementing Kociemba, one implementing a neural net to solve a cube
